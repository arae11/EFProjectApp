# EFProjectApp ReadMe

## Project Goal

- Have a WPF Front End
- Have and SQL database backend with at least two linked tables
- Use Entity Framework to manage the relationship between your backend object model and database
- Have a Business Layer with some logic

Create an application for CSGO players that allows them to upload strategies to a database. The application will allow for a user account system, providing a method for users to rate strategies. The aim of the app is to help users develop and share different strategies, overall broadening strategy knowledge for users to implement in-game.

CSGO is a competitive FPS game that is based around a bomb-defusal scenario. A match consists of a total of 30 rounds that last 1 minute and 55 seconds each with the objective to either eliminate every player on the other team, or plant/defuse the bomb. Due to the short time during a round it is imperative that the team leader organises the team effectively. This is why it is important for teams to have pre-set strategies that they execute each round in order to meet the objective within the time limit. Due to the way maps are created there is a vast number of ways to use utility further emphasising the need to strategy in a highly competitive setting.
